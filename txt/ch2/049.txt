	$ cd recipes

	$ ed pie/apple
	...
	$ ed cookie/choc.chip
	...
	$

Notice that it is simple to refer to subdirectories. pie/apple has an obvious
meaning: the apple pie recipe, in directory /usr/you/recipes/pie. You could
instead have put the recipe in, say, recipes/apple.pie, rather than in a
subdirectory of recipes, but it seems better organized to put all the pies
together, too. For example, the crust recipe could be kept in recipes/pie/crust
rather than duplicating it in each pie recipe.

Although the file system is a powerful organizational tool, you can forget where
you put a file, or even what files you've got. The obvious solution is a command
or two to rummage around the directories. The ls command is certainly helpful
for finding files, but it doesn't look in sub-directories.

	$ cd
	$ ls
	junk
	recipes
	$ file *
	junk:   ascii text
	recipes:        directory
	$ ls recipes
	cookie
	pie
	$ ls recipes/pie
	apple
	crust
	$
