There is a problem, of course, when several programs create files in /tmp at
once: they might interface with each other's files. That is why ed's temporary
file has peculiar name: it is constructed in such a way as to guarantee that no
other program will choose the same name for its temporary file. In Chapter 5 and
6 we will see ways to do this.

/usr is called the "user file system," although it may have little to do with
the actual users of the system. On our machine, our login directories are
/usr/bwk and /usr/rob, but on your machine the /usr part might be different, as
explained in Chapter 1. Whether or not your personal files are in a subdirectory
of /usr, there are a number of things you are likely to find there (although
local customs vary in this regard, too). Just as in /, there are directories
called /usr/bin, /usr/lib and /usr/tmp. These directories have functions similar
to their namesakes in /, but contain programs less critical to the system.For
example, nroff is usually in /usr/bin rather than /bin, and the FORTRAN compiler
libraries live in /usr/lib. Of course, just what is deems "critical" varies from
system to system. Some systems, such as the distributed 7th edition, have all
the programs in /bin and do away with /usr/bin altogether; other split /usr/bin
into two directories according to frequency of use.

Other directories in /usr/ are /usr/adm, containing accounting information and
/usr/dict, which holds a modest dictionary (see spell(1)). The on-line manual is
kept in /usr/man --- see /usr/man/man1/spell.1, for example. If your system has
source code on-line, you will probably find it in /usr/src.

It is worth spending a little time exploring the file system, especially /usr,
to develop a feeling for how the file system is organized and where you might
expect to find things.


2.7 Devices

We skipped over /dev in our tour, because the files there provide a nice review
of files in general. As you might guess from the name, /dev contains device
files.

One of prettiest ideas in the UNIX system is the way it deals with peripherals
--- discs, tape drives, line printers, terminals, etc. Rather than having
special system routines to, for example, read magnetic tape, there is a file
called /dev/mt0 (again, local customs vary). Inside the kernel, references to
that file are converted into hardware commands to access the tape, so if a
program reads /dev/mt0, the contents of a tape mounted on the drive are
returned. For example,

        $ cp /dev/mt0 jnk

copies the contents of the tape to a file called junk. cp has no idea there is
anything special about /dev/mt0; it is just a file --- a sequence of bytes.
