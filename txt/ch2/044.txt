output, the newline is expanded into carriage return and newline.

the UNIX system is unusual in its approach to representing control information,
particularly its use of newlines to terminate lines. Many systems instead
provide "records," one per line, each of which contains not only your data but
also a count of the number of characters in the line (and no newline). Other
systems terminate each line with a carriage return and a newline, because that
sequence is necessary for output on most terminals. (The word "linefeed" is
synonym for new line, so this sequence is often called "CRLF", which is nearly
pronounceable.)

The UNIX system does neither --- there are no records, no record counts, and no
bytes in any file that you or your programs did not put there. A newline is
expanded into a carriage return and a newline when sent to a terminal, but
programs need only deal with the single newline character, because that is all
they see. For most purposes, this simple scheme is exactly what is wanted. When
a more complicated structure is needed, it can easily be built on top of this;
the converse, creating simplicity from complexity, is harder to achieve.

Since the end of a line is marked by a newline character, you might expect a
file to be terminated by another special character, say \e for "end of file."
Looking at the output of od, though, you will see no special newline character
at the end of the file --- it just stops. Rather than using a special code, the
system signifies the end of a file by simply saying there is no more data in the
file. The kernel keeps track of file lengths, so a program encounters
end-of-file when it has processed all the bytes in file.

Programs retrieve the data in a file by a system call (a subroutine in the
kernel) called read. Each time read is called, it returns the next part of a
file --- the next line of text typed on the terminal, for example. read also
says how many bytes of the file were returned, so end of file is assumed when a
read says "zero bytes are being returned." If there were any bytes left, read
would have returned some of them. Actually, it makes sense not to represent end
of file by a special byte value, because, as we said earlier, the meaning of the
bytes depends on the interpretation of the file. But all files must end, and
since all files must be accessed through read, returning zero is an
interpretation-independent way to represent the end of a file without
introducing a new special character.

When a program reads from your terminal, each input line is given to the program
by the kernel only when you type its newline (i.e., press RETURN). Therefore if
you make a typing mistake, you can back up and correct it if you realize the
mistake before you type newline. If you type newline before realizing the error,
the line has been read by the system and you cannot correct it.

We can see how this line-at-a-time input works using cat. cat normally saves up
or buffers its output to write in large chunks for efficiency, but cat -u
"unbuffers" the output, so it is printed immediately as it is read:
