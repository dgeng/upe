The format of a file is determined by the programs that use it; there is a wide
variety of file types, perhaps because there is a wide variety of programs. But
since file types are not determined by the file system, the kernel can't tell
you the type of a file: it doesn't know it. The file command makes an educated
guess (we'll explain how shortly):

        $ file /bin /bin/ed /usr/src/cmd/ed.c /usr/man/man1/ed.1
        /bin:   directory
        /bin/ed:        pure executable
        /usr/src/cmd/ed.c:      c program text
        /usr/man/man1/ed.1:     roff, nroff, or eqn input text
        $ 

There are four fairly typical files, all related to the editor: the directory in
which it resides (/bin), the "binary" or runnable program itself (/bin/ed), the
"source" or C statements that define the program (/usr/src/cmd/ed.c) and the
manual page (/usr/man/man1/ed.1).

To determine the types, file didn't pay attention to the names (although it
could have), because naming conventions are just conventions, and thus not
perfectly reliable. For example, files suffixed .c are almost always C source,
but there is nothing to prevent you from creating a .c file with arbitrary
contents. Instead, file reads the first few hundred bytes of a file and looks
for clues to the file type. (As we will show later on, files with special system
properties, suck as directories, can be identified by asking the system, but
file could identify a directory by reading it.)

Sometimes the clues are obvious. A runnable program is marked by binary "magic
number" at its beginning. od with no options dumps the file in 16-bit, or
2-byte, words and makes the magic number visible:

        $ od /bin/ed
        0000000 000410 025000 000462 011444 000000 000000 000000 000001
        0000020 170011 016600 000002 005060 177776 010600 162706 000004
        0000040 016616 000004 005720 010066 000002 005720 001376 020076
        ...
        $

The octal value 410 marks a pure executable program, one for which the
executable code may be shared by several processes. (Specific magic numbers are
system dependent.) The bit pattern represented by 410 is not ASCII text, so this
value could not be created inadvertently by a program like an editor. But you
could certainly create such a file by running a program of your own, and the
system understands the convention that such files are program binaries.

For text files, the clues may be deeper in the file, so file looks for words
like #include to identify C source, or lines beginning with a period to identify
nroff or troff input.

You might wonder why the system doesn't track file types more carefully,
