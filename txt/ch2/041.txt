				CHAPTER 2: THE FILE SYSTEM

Everything in the UNIX system is a file. That is less of an oversimplification
than you might think. When the first version of the system was being designed,
before it even had a name, the discussions focused on the structure of a file
system that would be clean and easy to use. The file system is central to the
success and convenience of the UNIX system. It is one of the best examples of
the "keep it simple" philosophy, showing the power achieved by careful
implementation of a few well-chosen ideas.

To talk comfortably about commands and their interrelationships, we need a good
background in the structure and outer workings of the file system. This chapter
covers most of the details of using the file system --- what files are, how they
are represented, directories and the file system hierarchy, permissions, inodes
(the system's internal record of files) and device files. Because most use of
the UNIX system deals with manipulating files, there are many commands for file
manipulation and rearrangement; this chapter introduces the more commonly used
ones.


2.1 The basics of files

A file is a sequence of bytes. (A byte is small chunk of information, typically
8 bits long. For out purposes, a byte is equivalent to a character.) No
structure is imposed on a file by the system, and no meaning is attached to its
contents --- the meaning of the bytes depends solely on the programs that
interpret the file. Furthermore, as we shall see, this is true not just of disc
files but of peripheral devices as well. Magnetic tapes, mail messages,
characters typed on the keyboard, line printer output, data flowing in pipes ---
each of these is just a sequence of bytes as far as the system and the programs
in it are concerned.

The best way to learn about file is to play with them, so start by creating a
small file:
