Non-text files definitely have their place. For example, very large databases
usually need extra address information for rapid access, this has to be binary
for efficiency. But every file format that is not text must have its own family
of support programs to do things that the standard tools could perform if the
format were text. Text files may be a little less efficient in machine cycles,
but this must be balanced against the cost of extra software to maintain more
specialized formats. If you design a file format, you should think carefully
before choosing a non-textual representation. (You should also think about
making your programs robust in the face of long input lines.)


2.3 Directories and filenames

All the files you own have unambiguous names, starting with /usr/you, but if the
only file you have is junk, and you type ls, it doesn't print /usr/you/junk; the
filename is printed without any prefix:

        $ ls
	junk
	$

The current directory is an attribute of a process, not a person or a program
--- people have login directories, processes have current directories. If a
process creates child process, the child inherit the current directory of its
parent. But if the child then changes to a new directory, the parent is
unaffected --- its current directory remains the same no matter what the child
does.

The notion of a current directory is certainly a notational convenience, because
it can save a lot of typing, but its real purpose is organizational. Related
files belong together in the same directory. /usr is often the top directory of
the user file system. (user is abbreviated to usr in the same spirit as cmp, ls,
etc.) /usr/you is your login directory, your current directory when you first
login. /usr/src/ contains source for system programs, /usr/src/cmd contains
source for UNIX commands, /usr/src/cmd/sh contains the source files for the
shell, and so on. Whenever you embark on a new project, or whenever you have a
set of related files, say a set of recipes, you could create a new directory
with mkdir and put the files there.
