        $ ls -ld /usr/mary
        drwxrwxr-x 5 mary      704 Sep 25 10:18 /usr/mary

If a directory is writable, however, people can remove files in it regardless of
the permissions on the files themselves. If you want to make sure that you or
your friends never delete files from a directory, remove write permission from
it:

        $ cd
        $ date >temp
        $ chmod -w .                    Make directory unwritable
        $ ls -ld .
        dr-xr-xr-x 3 you        80 Sep 27 11:48 .
        $ rm temp
        rm: temp not removed            Can't remove file
        $ chmod 755 .                   Restore permission
        $ ls -ld .
        drwxr-xr-x 3 you        80 Sep 27 11:48 .
        $ rm temp
        $                               now you can

temp is now gone. Notice that changing the permissions on the directory didn't
change its modification date. The modification date reflects changes to the
file's contents, not its modes. The permissions and dates are not stored in the
file itself, but in a system structure called an index node, or i-node, the
subject of the next section.

Exercise 2-5. Experiment with chmod. Try different simple modes, like 0 and
1. Be careful not to damage your login directory!


2.5 Inodes

A file has several components: a name, contents, and administrative information
such as permissions and modification times. The administrative information is
stored in the inode (over the years, the hyphen fell out of "i-node"), along
with essential system data suck as how long it is, where on the disc the
contents of the file are stored, and so on.

There are three times in the inode: the time that the contents of the file were
last modified (written); the time that the file was last used (read or
executed); and the time that the inode itself was last changed, for example to
set permissions.
