protected from other users' access. But the set-uid concept is potentially
dangerous. /bin/passwd has to be corret; if it were not, it could destroy system
information under root's auspices. If it had the permissions -rwsrwxrwx, it
could be overwritten by any user, who could therefore replace the file with a
program that does anything. This is particularly serious for a set-uid program,
because root has access permissions to every file on the system. (Some UNIX
systems turn the set-uid bit off whenever a file is modified, to reduce the
danger of a security hole.)

The set-uid bit a powerful, but used primarily for a few system programs such as
passwd. Let's look at a more ordinary file.

        $ ls -l /bin/who
        -rwxrwxr-x 1 root     6348 Mar 29  1983 /bin/who
        $

who is executable by everybody, and writable by root and the owner's group, What
"executable" means is this: when you type

        $ who

to the shell, it looks in a set of directories, one of which is /bin, for a file
named "who." If it finds such a file, and if the file has execute permission,
the shell calls the kernel to run it. The kernel checks the permissions, and, if
they are valid, runs the program. Note that a program is just a file with
execute permission. In the next chapter we will show you programs that are just
text files, but that can be executed as commands because they have execute
permission set.

Directory permissions operate a little differently, but the basic idea is the
same.

        $ ls -ld .
        drwxrwxr-x 3 you        80 Sep 27 06:11 .
        $

The -d option of ls asks it to tell you about the directory itself, rather than
its contents, and the leading d in the output signifies that '.' is indeed a
directory. And r field means that you can read the directory, so you can find
out what files are in it with ls (or od, for that matter). A w means that you
can create and delete files in this directory, because that requires modifying
and therefore writing the directory file.

Actually, you cannot simply write in a directory --- even root is forbidden to
do so.

        $ who >.                      Try to overwrite '.'
        .: cannot create              you can't
        $ 

Instead there are system calls that create and remove files, and only through
them is it possible to change the contents of a directory. The permissions idea,
