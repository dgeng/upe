        $ /etc/mount
        rp01 on /usr
        $

In our case, the root system occupies /dev/rp00 (although this isn't reported by
/etc/mount) while the user file system --- the files in /usr and its
subdirectories --- reside on /dev/rp01

the root file system has to be present for the system to execute. /bin, /dev and
/etc are always kept on the root system, because when the system starts only
file in the root system are accessible, and some files such as /bin/sh are
needed to run at all. During the bootstrap operation, all the file systems are
checked for self-consistency (see icheck(8) or fsck(8)), and attached to the
root system. This attachment operation is called mounting, the software
equivalent of mounting a new disc pack in a drive; it can normally be done only
by the super-user. After /dev/rp01 has been mounted as /usr, the files in the
user file system are accessible exactly as if they were part of the root system.

For the average user, the details of which file subsystem is mounted where are
of little interest, but there are a couple of relevant points. First, because
the subsystems may be mounted and dismounted, it is illegal to make a link to a
file in another subsystem. For example, it is impossible to link programs in
/bin to convenient names in private bin directories, because /usr is in a
different file subsystem from /bin:

        $ ln /bin/mail /usr/you/bin/m
        ln: Cross-device link
        $

There would also be a problem because inode numbers are not unique in different
file systems.

Second, each subsystem has fixed upper limits on size (number of blocks
available for files) and inodes. If a subsystem fills up, it will be impossible
to enlarge files in that subsystem until some space is reclaimed. The df (disc
free space) command reports the available space on the mounted file subsystems:

        $ df
        /dev/rp00 1989
        /dev/rp01 21257

/usr has 21257 free blocks. Whether this is ample space or a crisis depends on
how the system is used; some installations need more file space headroom than
others. By the way, of all the commands, df probably has the widest variation in
output format. Your df output may look quite different.

Let's turn how to some more generally useful things. When you log in, you get a
terminal line and therefore a file in /dev through which the characters
