links would reflect the change. cp makes copies of files:

        $ cp junk copyofjunk
        $ ls -li
        total 3
        15850 -rw-rw-rw- 1 you         2 Sep 27 13:13 copyofjunk
        15768 -rw-rw-rw- 1 you         2 Sep 27 12:37 junk
        15274 drwxrwxrwx 4 you        64 Sep 27 09:34 recipes
        $

The i-numbers of junk and copyofjunk are different, because they are different
files, even though they currently have the same contents. It's often a good idea
to change the permissions on a backup copy so it's harder to remove it
accidentally.

        $ chmod -w copyofjunk           Turn off writ permission
        $ ls -li
        total 3
        15850 -r--r--r-- 1 you         2 Sep 27 13:13 copyofjunk
        15768 -rw-rw-rw- 1 you         2 Sep 27 12:37 junk
        15274 drwxrwxrwx 4 you        64 Sep 27 09:34 recipes
        $ rm copyofjunk
        rm: copyofjunk 444 mode n       No! It's precious
        $ date >junk
        $ ls -li
        total 3
        15850 -r--r--r-- 1 you         2 Sep 27 13:13 copyofjunk
        15768 -rw-rw-rw- 1 you        29 Sep 27 13:16 junk
        15274 drwxrwxrwx 4 you        64 Sep 27 09:34 recipes
        $ rm copyofjunk
        rm: copyofjunk 444 mode y       Well, maybe not so precious
        $ ls -li
        total 2
        15768 -rw-rw-rw- 1 you        29 Sep 27 13:16 junk
        15274 drwxrwxrwx 4 you        64 Sep 27 09:34 recipes
        $

Changing the copy of a file doesn't change the original, and removing the copy
has no effect on the original. Notice that because copyofjunk had write
permission turned off, rm asked for confirmation before removing the file.

There is one more common command for manipulating files: mv moves or renames
files, simply by rearranging the links. Its syntax is the same as cp and ln:
