sameoldjunk is the same file as our old junk, right down to the i-number; only
its name --- the directory entry associated with inode 15768 --- has been
changed.

We have been doing all this file shuffling in one directory, but it also works
across directories. ln is often used to put links with the same name in several
directories, suck as when several people are working on program or document. mv
can move a file or directory from one directory to another. In fact, these are
common enough idioms that mv and cp have special syntax for them:

        $ mv (or cp) file1 file2 ... directory

moves (or copies) one or more files to the directory which is the last
argument. The links or copies are made with the same filenames. For example, if
you wanted to try your hand at beefing up the editor, you might begin by saying

        $ cp /usr/src/comd/ed.c .

to get your own copy of the source to play with. If you were going to work on
the shell, which is in a number of different source files, you would say

        $ mkdir sh
        $ cp /usr/src/cmd/sh/* sh

and cp would duplicate all of the shell's source files in your subdirectory sh
(assuming no subdirectory structure in /usr/src/cmd/sh --- cp is not every
clever). On some systems, ln also accepts multiple file arguments, again with a
directory as the last argument. And on some systems, mv, cp and ln are
themselves links to a single file that examines its name to see what service to
perform.


Exercise 2-6. Why does ls -l report 4 links to recipes? Hint: try

        $ ls -ld /usr/you

Why is this useful informatin?

Exercise 2-7. What is the difference between

        $ mv junk junk1

and

        $ cp junk junk1
        $ rm junk

Hint: make a link to junk, then try it.
