however, still applies: the w fields tell who can use the system routines to
modify the directory.

Permission to remove a file is independent of the file itself. If you have write
permission in a directory, you may remove files there, even files that are
protected against writing. The rm command asks for confirmation before removing
a protected file, however, to check that you really want to do so --- one of the
rare occasions that a UNIX program double-checks your intentions. (the -f flag
to rm forces it to remove files without question.)

The x field in the permissions on a directory does not mean execution; it means
"search." Execute permission on a directory determines whether the directory may
be searched for a file. It is therefore possible to create a directory with mode
--x for other users, implying that users may access any file that they know
about in that directory, but may not run ls on it or read it to see what files
are there. Similarly, with directory permissions r--, users can see (ls) but not
user the contents of a directory. Some installations use this device to turn off
/usr/games during busy hours.

The chmod (change mode) command changes permissions on files.

        $ chmod permissions filenames ...

The syntax of the permissions is clumsy, however. They can be specified in two
ways, either as octal numbers or by symbolic description. The octal numbers are
easier to use, although the symbolic descriptions are sometimes convenient
because they can specify relative changes in the permissions. It would be nice
if you could say

        $ chmod rw-rw-rw- junk          Doesn't work this way!

rather than

        $ chmod 666 junk

but you cannot. The octal modes are specified by adding together a 4 for read, 2
for write and 1 for execute permission. The three digits specify, as in ls,
permissions for the owner, group and everyone else. The symbolic codes are
difficult to explain; you must look in chmod(1) for a proper description. For
our purposes, it is sufficient to note that + turns a permission on and that -
turns it off. For example

        $ chmod +x command

allows everyone to execute command, and

        $ chmod -w file

turns off write permission for everyone, including the file's owner. Except for
the usual disclaimer about super-users, only the owner of a file may change the
permissions on a file, regardless of the permissions themselves. Even if
somebody else allows you to write a file, the system will not allow you to
change
