The command du (disc usage) was written to tell how much disc space is consumed
by the files in a directory, including all its subdirectories.

$ du
6       ./recipes/pie
4       ./recipes/cookie
11      ./recipes
13      .
$ 

The filenames are obvious; the numbers are the number of disc blocks ---
typically 512 or 1024 bytes each --- of storage for each file. The value for a
directory indicates how many blocks are consumed by all the files in that
directory and its subdirectories, including the directory itself.

du has an option -a, for "all," that causes it to print out all the files in a
directory. If one of those is a directory, du processes that as well:

        $ du -a
        2       ./recipes/pie/apple
        3       ./recipes/pie/crust
        6       ./recipes/pie
        3       ./recipes/cookie/choc.chip
        4       ./recipes/cookie
        11       ./recipes
        1       ./junk
        13       .
        $ 

The output of du -a can be piped through grep to look for specific files:

        $ du -a | grep choc
        3       ./recipes/cookie/choc.chip
        $ 

Recall from Chapter 1 that the name '.' is a directory entry that refers to the
directory itself; it permits access to a directory without having to know the
full
