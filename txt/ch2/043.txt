ordinal number of the next character shown, in octal. By the way, the emphasis
on octal numbers is a holdover from the PDP-11, for which octal was the
preferred notation. Hexadecimal is better suited for other machines; the -x
option tells od to print in hex.

Notice that there is a character after each line, with octal value 012. This is
the ASCII newline character; it is what the system places in the input when you
press the RETURN key. By a convention borrowed from C, the character
representation of a newline is \n, but this is only a convention used by
programs like od to make it easy to read --- the value stored in the file is the
single byte 012.

Newline is the most common example of a special character. Other characters
associated with some terminal control operation include backspace (octal value
-10, printed as \b), tab (011, \t), and carriage return (015, \r).

It is important in each case to distinguish between how the character is stored
in a file and how it is interpreted in various situations. For example, when you
type a backspace on your keyboard (and assuming that your erase character is
backspace), the kernel interprets it to mean that you want to discard whatever
character you typed previously. Both that character and the backspace disappear,
but the backspace is echoed to your terminal, where is makes the cursor move on
position backwards.

If you type the sequence

        \<-

(i.e., \ followed by a backspace), however, the kernel interprets that to mean
that you want a literal backspace in your input, so the \ is discarded and the
byte 010 winds up in your file. When the backspace is echoed on your terminal,
it moves the cursor to sit on top of the \.

When you print a file that contains a backspace, the backspace is passed
uninterpreted to your terminal, which again will move the cursor one position
backwards. When you use od to display a file that contains a backspace, it
appears as a byte with value 010, or, with the -c option, as \b.

The story for tabs is much the same: on input, a tab character is echoed to your
terminal and sent to the program that is reading; on output, the tab is simply
sent to the terminal for interpretation there. There is a difference, though ---
you can tell the kernel that you want it to interpret tabs for you on output; in
that case, each tab that would be printed is replaced by the right number of
blanks to get to the next tab stop. Tab stops are set at columns 9, 17, 25,
etc. The command

        $ stty -tabs

causes tabs to be replaced by spaces when printed on your terminal. See stty(1).

The treatment of RETURN is analogous. The kernel echoes RETURN as a carriage
return and a newline, but stores only the newline in the input. On
