Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter, it
is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command. Because
it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command
execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design. The
range of its application leads to an unsettling quantity of detail in the
language, but you don't need to understand every nuance to use it
effectively. This chapter explains the basics of shell programming by showing
the evolution of some useful shell programs. It is not a manual for the
shell. That is in the manual page sh(1) of the Unix Programmer's Manual, which
you should have handy while you are reading.

With the shell, as with most commands, the details of behavior can often be most
quickly discovered by experimentation. The manual can be cryptic, and there is
nothing better than a good example to clear things up. For that reason, this
chapter is organized around examples rather than shell features; it is a guide
to using the shell for programming, rather than an encyclopedia of its
capabilities. We will talk not only about what the shell can do, but also about
developing and writing shell programs, with an emphasis on testing ideas
interactively.

When you've written a program, in the shell or any other language, it may be
helpful enough that other people on your system would like to use it. But the
standards other people expect of a program are usually more rigorous than those
you apply for yourself. A major theme in shell programming is therefore making
programs robust so they can handle improper input and give helpful information
when things go wrong.


5.1 Customizing the cal command

One common use of a shell program is to enhance or to modify the user interface
to a program. As an example of a program that could stand enhancement, consider
the cal(1) command:
