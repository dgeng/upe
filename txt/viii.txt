especially for programmers. The UNIX programming environment is unusually rich
and productive.

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and
techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it
effective is an approach to programming, a philosophy of using the
computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence,
at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the
relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX
programs do quite trivial tasks in isolation, but, combined with other programs,
become general and useful tools.

Our goal in this book is to communicate the UNIX programming philosophy. Because
the philosophy is based on the relationships between programs, we must devote
most of the space to discussions about the individual tools, but throughout run
the themes of combining programs and of using programs to build programs. To use
the UNIX system and its components well, you must understand not only how to use
the programs, but also how they fit into the environment.

As the UNIX system has spread, the fraction of its users who are skilled in its
application has decreased. Time and again, we have seen experienced users,
ourselves included, find only clumsy solutions to a problem, or write programs
to do jobs that existing tools handle easily. Of course, the elegant solutions
are not easy to see without some experience and understanding. We hope that by
reading this book you will develop the understanding to make your use of the
system --- whether you are a new or seasoned user --- effective and
enjoyable. We want you to use the UNIX system well.

We are aiming at individual programmers, in the hope that, by making their work
more productive, we can in turn make the work of groups more
productive. Although our main target is programmers, the first four or five
chapters do not require programming experience to be understood, so they should
be helpful to other users as well.

Wherever possible we have tried to make our points with real examples rather
than artificial ones. Although some programs began as examples for the book, the
have since become part of our own set or everyday programs. All examples have
been tested directly from the text, which is in a machine-readable form.

The book is organized as follows. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the most basic
use of the system. It covers logging in, mail, the file system, commonly-used
commands, and the rudiments of the command interpreter. Experienced users can
skip this chapter.

Chapter 2 is a discussion of the UNIX file system. The file system is central to
the operation and use of the system, so you must understand it to use the system
well. This chapter describes files and directories, permissions and file modes,
and inodes. It concludes with a tour of the file system hierarchy and an
explanation of device files.
