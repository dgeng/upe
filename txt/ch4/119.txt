66-lines pages that will be produced by running a set of files through pr. This
can be wrapped up in a command called prpages:

	$ cat prpages
	# prpages: compute number of pages that pr will print
	wc $* |
	awk '!/total$/ { n += int(($1+55)) / 56) }
	    END	       { print n }'
	$

pr puts 56 lines of text on each page (a fact determined empirically). The
number of pages is rounded up, then truncated to an integer with the built-in
function int, for each line of wc output that does not match total at the end of
a line.

	$ wc ch4.*
	    753     3090   18129 ch4.1
	    612     2421   13242 ch4.2
	    637     2462   13455 ch4.3
	    802     2986   16904 ch4.4
	    50       213    1117 ch4.9
	    2854   11172   62847 total
	$ prpages ch4.*
	53
	$

To verify the result, run pr into awk directly:

        $ pr ch4.* | awk 'END { print NR/66 }'

Variables in awk also store strings of characters. Whether a variable is to be
treated as a number of as a string of characters depends on the context. Roughly
speaking, in an arithmetic expression like s+=$1, the numeric value is used; in
a string context like x="abc", the string value is used; and in an ambiguous
case like x>y, the string value is used unless the operands are clearly
numeric. (The rules are stated precisely in the awk manual.) String variables
are initialized to the empty string. Comping sections will put strings to good
use.

awk itself maintains a number of built-in variables of both types, such as NR
and FS. Table 4.3 gives the complete list. Table 4.4 lists the operators.

Exercise 4-8. Our test of prpages suggests alternate implementations. Experiment
to see which is fastest.


Control flow

It is remarkably easy (speaking from experience) to create adjacent duplicate
words, accidentally when editing a big document, and it is obvious that that
almost never happens intentionally. To prevent such problems, one of the
