or for; the continue statement causes the next iteration to being (at condition
in the while and expression2 in the for). The next statement causes the next
input line to be read and pattern matching to resume at the beginning of the awk
program. The exit statement causes an immediate transfer to the END pattern.


Arrays

awk provides arrays, as do most programming languages. As a trivial example,
this awk program collects each line of input in a separate array element,
indexed by line number, then prints them out in reverse order:

        $ cat bakcwards
	# backwards:  print input in backward line order
        awk '   { line[NR] = $0 }
        END { for (i = NR; i > 0; i--) print line[i] } ' $*
	$

Notice that, like variables, arrays don't have to be declared; the size of an
array is limited only by the memory available on your machine. Of course if a
very large file is being read into an array, it may eventually run out of
memory. To print the end of a large file in reverse order requires cooperation
with tail:

	$ tail -5 /usr/dict/web2 | backwards
	zymurgy
	zymotically
	zymotic
	zymosthenic
	zymosis
	$

tails takes advantage of a file system operation called seeking, to advance to
the end of a file without reading the intervening data. Look at the dicussion of
lseek in Chapter 7. (Our local version of tail has an option -r that prints the
lines in reverse order, which supersedes backwards.)

Normal input processing splits each input line into fields. It is possible to
perform the same field-splitting operation on any string with the built-in
function split:

        n = split(s, arr, sep)

splits the string s into fields that are stored in elements 1 through n of the
array arr. If a separator character sep is provided, it is used; otherwise the
current value is FS is used. For example, split($0,a,":") splits the input line
on colons, which is suitable for processing /etc/passwd, and
split("9/29/83",date,"/") splits a date on slashes.
