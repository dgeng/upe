quotes to protect a * and a tab from being interpreted by the shell:

        $ du -a ch4.* | sed 's/.*->//'
        ch4.1
        ch4.2
        ch4.3
        ch4.4
        ch4.9
        $

The substitution deletes all characters (.*) up to and including the rightmost
tab (shown in the pattern as ->).

In a similar way, you could select the user names and login times from the
output the who:

        $ who
        ir       tty1    Sep 29 07:41
        ron      tty3    Sep 29 10:31
        you      tty4    Sep 29 08:36
        td       tty5    Sep 29 08:47
        $ who | sed 's/ .* / /'
        ir 07:14
        ron 10:31
        you 08:36
        td 08:47
        $

The s command replaces a blank and everything that follows it (as much as
possible, including more blanks) up to another blank by a single blank. Again,
quotes are needed.

Almost the same sed command can be used to make a program getname that will
return your user name:

        $ cat getname
        who am i | sed 's/ .*//'
        $ getname
        you
        $

Another sed sequence is used so frequently that we have made it into a shell
file called ind. The ind command indents its input one tab stop; it is handy for
moving something over to fit better onto line-printer paper.

The implementation of ind is easy --- stick a tab at the front of each line:

        sed 's/^/->/' $*                    Version 1 of ind

This version even puts a tab on each empty line, which seems unnecessary. A
better version uses sed's ability to select the lines to be modified. If you
prefix a pattern to the command, only the lines that match the pattern will be
affected:
