        awk '
        BEGIN { n = '$1' }
        {       for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
                        sum[i] += $1
        }
        END {   for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                        printf "%6g ", sum[i]
                        total += sum[i]
                }
                printf "; total = %6g ", total
        } '


We use a BEGIN to insert the value of n into a variable, rather than cluttering
up the rest of the program with quotes.

The main problem with all these examples is not keeping track of whether one is
inside or outside of the quotes (though that is a bother), but that as currently
written, such programs can read only their standard input; there is no way to
pass them both the parameter n and an arbitrarily long list of filenames. This
requires some shell programming that we'll address in the next chapter.


A calendar service based on awk

One final example uses associative arrays; it is also an illustration of how to
interact with the shell, and demonstrates a bit about program evolution.

The task is to have the system send you mail every morning that contains a
reminder of upcoming events. (There may already be such as calendar service; see
calendar(1). This section shows an alternate approach.) The basic service should
tell you of events happening today; the second step is to give a day of warning
--- events of tomorrow as well as today. The proper handling of weekends and
holidays is left as an exercise.

The first requirement is a place to keep the calendar. For that, a file called
calendar in /usr/you seems easiest.

        $ cat calendar
        Sep 30  mother's birthday
        Oct  1  lunch with joe, noon
        Oct  1  meeting 4pm

Second, you need a way to scan the calendar for a date. There are many choices
here; we will use awk because it is best at doing the arithmetic necessary to
get from "today" to "tomorrow," but other programs like sed or egrep can also
service. The lines selected from the calendar are shipped off by mail, of
course.

Third, you need a way to have calendar scanned reliably and automatically every
day, probably early in the morning. This can be done with at, which we mentioned
briefly in Chapter 1.
