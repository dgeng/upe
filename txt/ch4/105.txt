Why are there three grep programs? fgrep interprets no metacharacters, but can
look efficiently for thousands of words in parallel (once initialized, its
running time is independent of the number of words), and thus is used primarily
for tasks like bibliographic searches. The size of typical fgrep patterns is
beyond the capacity of the algorithms used in grep and egrep. The distinction
between grep and egrep is harder to justify. grep came much earlier, uses the
regular expressions familiar from ed, and has tagged regular expressions and a
wider set of options. egrep interprets more general expressions (except for
tagging), and runs significantly faster (with speed independent of the pattern),
but the standard version takes longer to start when the expression is
complicated. A newer version exists that starts immediately, so egrep and grep
would now be combined into a single pattern matching program.

Exercise 4-1. Loop up tagged regular expressions (\( and \)) in Appendix 1 or
ed(1), and use grep to search for palindromes --- words spelled the same
backwards as forwards. Hint: write a different pattern for each length or word.

Exercise 4-2. The structure of grep is to read a single line, check for a match,
then loop. How would grep be affected if regular expressions could match
newlines?
