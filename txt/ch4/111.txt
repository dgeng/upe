        $ sed '/pattern/q'

prints its input up to and including the first line matching pattern, and

        $ sed '/pattern/d'

deletes every line that contains pattern; the deletion happens before the line
is automatically printed, so deleted lines are discarded.

Although automatic printing is usually convenient, sometimes it gets in the
way. It can be turned off by the -n option; in that case, only lines explicitly
printed with a p command appear in the output. For example,

        $ sed -n '/pattern/p'

does what grep does. Since the matching condition can be inverted by following
it with !,

        $ sed -n '/pattern/!p'

is grep -v. (So is sed '/pattern/d'.)

Why do we have both sed and grep? After all, grep is just a simple special case
of sed. Part of the reason is history --- grep came well before sed. But grep
survives, and indeed thrives, because for the particular job that they both do,
it is significantly easier to use than sed is: it does the common case about as
succinctly as possible. (It also does a few things that sed won't; look at the
-b option, for instance.) Programs do die, however. There was once a program
called gres that did simple substitution, but it expired almost immediately when
sed was born.

Newlines can be inserted with sed, using the same syntax as in ed:

        $ sed 's/$/\
        > /'

adds a newline to the end of each line, thus double-spacing its input, and

        $ sed 's/[ ->][ ->]/\
        > /g'
 
replaced each string of blanks or tabs with a newline and thus slits its input
into one word per line. (The regular expression '[ ->]' matches a blank or tab;
'[ ->]*' matches zero or more of these, so the whole pattern matches one or more
blanks and/or tabs.)

You can also use pairs of regular expressions or line numbers to select a range
of lines over which any one of the commands will operate.
