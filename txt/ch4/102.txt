4.1 The grep family

We mentioned grep briefly in Chapter 1, and have used it in examples since then.

        $ grep pattern filenames...

searches the named files or the standard input and prints each line that
contains an instance of the pattern. grep is invaluable for finding occurrences
of variables in programs or words in documents, or for selecting parts of the
output of a program:

        $ grep -n variable *.[ch]             Locate variable in C source
        $ grep From $MAIL                     Print message headers in mailbox
        $ grep From $MAIL | grep -v mary      Headers that didn't come from mary
        $ grep -y mary $HOME/lib/phone-book   Find mary's phone number
        $ who | grep mary                     See if mary is logged in
        $ ls | grep -v temp                   Filenames that don't contain temp

The option -n prints line numbers, -v inverts the sense of the test, and -y
makes lower case letters in the pattern match letters of either case in the
file. (upper case still matches only upper case.)

In all the examples we've seen so far, grep has looked for ordinary strings of
letters and numbers. But grep can actually search for much more complicated
patterns: grep interprets expressions in a simple language for describing
strings.

Technically, the patterns are a slightly restricted form of the string specified
called regular expressions. grep interprets the same regular expressions as ed;
in fact, grep was originally created (in an evening) by straightforward surgery
on ed.

Regular expressions are specified by giving special meaning to certain
characters, just like *, etc., used by the shell. There are a few more
metacharacters, and, regrettably, differences in meanings. Table 4.1 shows all
the regular expression metacharacters, but we will review them briefly here.

The metacharacters ^ and $ "anchor" the pattern to the beginning (^) or end ($)
of the line. For example,

        $ grep From $MAIL

locates lines containing From in your mailbox, but

        $ grep '^From' $MAIL

prints lines that begin with From, which are more likely to be message header
lines. Regular expressions matacharacters overlap with shell metacharacters, so
it's always a good idea to enclose grep patterns in single quotes.

grep supports character classes much like those in the shell, so [a-z] matches
any lower case letter. But there are differences; if a grep character class
begins with a circumflex ^, the pattern matches any character except
