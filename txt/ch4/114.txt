another), it only makes one pass over the data, it's not possible to go
backwards, there's no way to do forward references like /.../+1, and it provides
no facilities for manipulating numbers --- it is purely a text editor.

Exercise 4-5. Modify older and newer so they don't include the argument file in
their output. Change them so the files are listed in the opposite order.

Exercise 4-6. Use sed to make bundle robust. Hint: in here document, the end
marking word is recognized only when it matches the lines exactly.


4.4 The awk pattern scanning and processing language

Some of the limitations of sed are remedied by awk. The idea in awk is much the
same as in sed, but the detials are based more on the C programming language
than on a text editor. Usage is just like sed:

        $ awk 'program' filenames ...

but the program is different:

        pattern { action }
        pattern { action }
        ...

awk reads the input in the filenames one line at a time. Each line is compared
with each pattern in order; for each pattern that matches the line, the
corresponding action is performed. Like sed, awk does not alter its input files.

The patterns can be regular expressions exactly as in egrep, or they can be more
complicated conditions reminiscent of C. As a simple example, thought,

        $ awk '/regular expression/ { print }' filenames ...

does what egrep does: it prints every line that matches the regular expression.

Either the pattern or the action is optional. If the action is omitted, the
default action is to print matched lines, so

        $ awk '/regular expression/' filenames ...

does the same job as the previous example. Conversely, if the pattern is
omitted, then the action part is done for every input line. So

        $ awk '{ print }' filenames ...

does what cat does, albeit more slowly.

One final note before we get on to interesting examples. As with sed, it is
possible to present the program to awk from a file:

        $ awk -f cmdfile filenames ...
