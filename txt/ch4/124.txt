value pairs like those above, whether or not they are sorted. Each name ($1) is
used as a sbuscript in sum; at the end, a special form of the for statement is
used to cycle through all the elements of sum, printing them out. Syntactically,
this variant of the for statement is

        for (var in array)
                statement

Although it might look superficially like the for loop in the shell, it's
unrelated. It loops over the subscripts of array, not the elements, setting var
to each subscript in turn. The subscripts are produced in an unpredictable
order, however, so it may be necessary to sort them. In the example above, the
output can be piped into sort to list the people with the largest values at the
top.

        $ awk '...' | sort +1nr

The implementation of associative memory uses a hashing scheme to ensure that
access to any element takes about the same time as to any other, and that (at
least for moderate array sizes) the time doesn't depend on how many elements are
in the array.

The associative memory is effective for tasks like counting all the words in the
input:

        $ cat wordfreq
        awk '   { for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) num[$i]++ }
        END     { for (word in num) print word, num[word] }
        ' $*
        $ wordfreq ch4.* | sort +1 -nr | sed 20q | 4
        the 372          .CW 345          of 220           is 185
        to 175           a 167            in 109           and 100
        .PI 94           .P2 94           .PP 90           $ 87
        awk 87           sed 83           that 76          for 75
        The 63           are 61           line 55          print 52
        $

The first for loop looks at each word in the input line, incrementing the
element of array num subscripted by the word. (Don't confuse awk's $i, the i'th
field of the input line, with any shell variable.) After the file has been read,
the second for loop prints, in arbitrary order, the words and their counts.

Exercise 4-9. The output from wordfreq includes text formatting commands like
.CW, which is used to print words in this font. How would you get rid of such
non-words? how would you use tr to make wordfreq work properly regardless of the
case of its input? Compare the implementation and performance of wordfreq to the
pipeline from Section 4.2 and to this one:

        sed 's/[ ->][ ->]*/\
        /g' $* | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
