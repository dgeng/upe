        sed '/./s/^/->/' $*             Version 2 of ind

The pattern /./ matches any line that has at least one character on it other
than a newline; the s command is done for those lines but not for empty
lines. Remember that sed outputs all lines regardless of whether they were
changed, so empty lines are still produced as they should be.

There's yet another way that ind could be written. It is possible to do the
commands only on lines that don't match the selection pattern, by preceding the
command with an exclamation mark '!'. In

        sed '/^$/!s/^/->/'            Version 3 of ind

the pattern /^$/ matches empty lines (the end of the line immediately follows
the beginning), so /^$/! says, "don't do the command on empty lines."

As we said above, sed prints each line automatically, regardless of what was
done to it (unless it was deleted). Furthermore, most ed commands can be
used. So it's easy to write a sed program that will print the first three (say)
lines of input, then quit:

        sed 3q

Although 3q is not a legal ed command, it makes sense in sed: copy lines, then
quit after the third one.

You might want to do other processing to the data, such as indent it. One way it
to run the output from sed through ind, but since sed accepts multiple commands,
it can be done with a single (somewhat unlikely) invocation of sed:

        sed 's/^/->
             3q'

Notice where the quotes and the newline are: the commands have to be on separate
lines, but sed ignores leading blanks and tabs.

With these ideas, it might seem sensible to write a program, called head, to
print the first few lines of each filename argument. But sed 3q (or 10q) is so
easy to type that we've never felt the need. We do, however, have an ind, since
its equivalent sed command is harder to type. (In the process of writing this
book we replaced the existing 30-line C program by version 2 of the one-line
implementation shown above). There is no clear criterion for when it's worth
making a separate command from a complicated command line; the best rule we've
found is to put it in your bin and see if you actually use it.

It's also possible to put sed commands in a file and execute them from there,
with

        $ sed -f filename ...

You can use line selectors other than numbers line 3:
