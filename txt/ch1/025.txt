like cat or ls, except that they have been collected into a couple of
directories to be easy to find the administer. To verify this, try to execute
some of these programs by using their full pathnames:

        $ /bin/date
        Mon Sep 26 23:29:32 EDT 1983
        $ /bin/who
        srm      tty1    Sep 26 22:20
        cvw      tty4    Sep 26 22:40
        you      tty5    Sep 26 23:04
        $

Exercise 1-3. Try

         $ ls /usr/games

and do whatever comes naturally. Things might be more fun outside of normal
working hours.


Changing directory --- cd

if you work regularly with Mary on information in her directory, you can say "I
want to work on Mary's files instead of my own." This is done by changing your
current directory with the cd command:

        $ cd /usr/mary

Now when you use a filename (without /'s) as an argument to cat or pr, it refers
to the file in Mary's directory. Changing directories doesn't affect any
permissions associated with a file --- if you couldn't access a file from your
own directory, changing to another directory won't alter that fact.

It is usually convenient to arrange your own files so that all the files related
to one thing are in directory separate from other projects. For example, if you
want to write a book, you might want to keep all the text in a directory called
book. The command mkdir makes a new directory.

$ mkdir book                  Make a directory
$ cd book                     Go to it
$ pwd                         Make sure you're in the right place
/usr/you/book

...                           Write the book (several minutes pass)
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/usr/you
$

'..' refers to the parent of whatever directory you are currently in, the
directory one level closer to the root. '.' a synonym for the current directory.

$ cd                          Return to home directory
