work. For example,

        $ sort
        ghi
        abc
        def
        ctl-d
        abc
        def
        ghi
        $

In the next section, we will see how this principle is exploited.

Exercise 1-5. Explain why

         $ ls >ls.out

causes ls.out to be included in the list of names.

Exercise 1-6. Explain the output from

        $ wc temp >temp

If you misspell a command name, as in

        $ woh >temp

what happens?


Pipes

All of the examples at the end of the previous section rely on the same trick:
putting the output of one program into the input of another via a temporary
file. But the temporary file has no other purpose; indeed, it's clumsy to have
to use such a file. This observation leads to one of the fundamental
contribution of the UNIX system, the idea of a pipe. A pipe is a way to connect
the output of one program to the input of another program without any temporary
file; a pipeline is a connection of two or more programs through pipes.

Let us revise some the earlier examples to use pipes instead of temporaries. The
vertical bar character | tells the shell to set up a pipeline:

        $ who | sort               Print sorted list of users
        $ who | wc -l              Count users
        $ ls | wc -l               Count files
        $ ls | pr -3               3-column list of filenames
        $ who | grep mary          Look for particular user

Any program that read from the terminal can read from a pipe instead; any
program that writes on the terminal can write to a pipe. This is where the
convention of reading the standard input when no files are named pays off: any
program that adheres to the convention can be used in pipelines: grep, pr, sort
and wc are all used that way in the pipelines above.

You can have as many programs in a pipeline as you wish:
