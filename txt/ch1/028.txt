        $ rm *

removes all files in your current directory. (You had better be very sure that's
what you want to say!)

The * is not limited to the last position in a filename --- *'s can be anywhere
and can occur several times. Thus

        $ rm *.save

removes all files that end with .save.

Notice that the filenames are sorted alphabetically, which is not the same as
numerically. If your book has ten chapters, the order might not be what you
intended, since ch10 comes before ch2:

	$ echo *
	ch1.1 ch1.2 ... ch10.1 ch10.2 ... ch2.1 ch2.2 ...
	$

The * is not the only pattern-matching feature provided by the shell, although
it's by far the most frequently used. The pattern [...] matches any of the
characters inside the brackets. A range of consecutive letters or digits can be
abbreviated:

	$ pr ch[12346789]*  Print chapters 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 but not 5
	$ pr ch[1-46-9]*    Same thing
	$ rm temp[a-z]	    Remove any of tempa, ... tempz that exists

The ? pattern matches any single character:

	$ ls ?	      	    List files with single-character names
	$ ls -l ch?.1	    List ch1.1 ch2.1 ch3.1, etc. but not ch10.1
	$ rm temp?	    Remove files temp1, ..., tempa, etc.

Note that the patterns match only existing filenames. In particular, you cannot
make up new filenames by using patterns. For example, if you want to expand ch
to chapter in each filename, you cannot do it this way:

        $ mv ch.* chapter.*     Doesn't work!

because chapter.* matches no existing filenames.

Pattern characters like * can be used in pathnames as well as simple filenames;
the match is done for each component of the path that contains a special
character. Thus /user/mary/* performs the match in /usr/mary, and
/usr/*/calendar generates a list of pathnames of all user calendar files.

If you should ever have to turn off the special meaning of *, ?, etc., enclose
the entire argument in single quotes, as in

        $ ls '?'

You can also precede a special character with a backslash:
