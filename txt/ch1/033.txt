Processes

The shell does quite a few things besides setting up pipes. Let us turn briefly
to the basics of running more than one program at a time, since we have already
seen a bit of that with pipes. For example, you can run two programs with one
command line by separating the commands with a semicolon; the shell recognizes
the semicolon and breaks the line into two commands.

        $ date; who
        Tue Sep 27 01:03:17 EDT 1983
        ken      tty0    Sep 27 00:43
        dmr      tty1    Sep 26 23:45
        rob      tty2    Sep 26 23:59
        bwk      tty3    Sep 27 00:06
        jj       tty4    Sep 26 23:31
        you      tty5    Sep 26 23:04
        ber      tty7    Sep 26 23:34
        $

Both commands are executed (in sequence) before the shell returns with a prompt
character.

You have also have more than one program running simultaneously if you wish. For
example, suppose you want to do something time-consuming like counting the words
in your book, but you don't want to wait for wc to finish before you start
something else. Then you can say

        $ wc ch* >wc.out &
        6944                    Process-id printed by the shell
        $

The ampersand & at the end of a command line says to the shell "start this
command running, then take further commands from the terminal immediately," that
is, don't wait for it to complete. Thus the command will begin, but you can do
something else while it's running. Directing the output into the file wc.out
keeps it from interfering with whatever you're doing at the same time.

An instance of a running program is called a process. The number printed by the
shell for a command initiated with & is called the process-id; you can use it in
other commands to refer to a specific running program.

It's important to distinguish between programs and processes. wc is a program;
each time you run the program wc, that creates a new process. If several
instances of the same program are running at the same time, each is a separate
process with a different process-id.

If a pipeline is initiated with &, as in
