Your file named junk is unrelated to Paul's or to Mary's.

Pathnames aren't too exciting if all the files of interest are in your own
directory, but if you work with someone else or on several projects
concurrently, they become handy indeed. For example, your friends can print your
junk by saying

        $ cat /usr/you/junk

Similarly, you can find out what files May has by saying

        $ ls /usr/mary
        data
        junk
        $

or make your own copy of one of her files by

        $ cp /usr/mary/data data

or edit her file:

        $ ed /usr/mary/data

if Mary doesn't want you poking around in her files, or vise versa, privacy can
be arranged. Each file and directory has read-write-execute permissions for the
owner, a group, and everyone else, which can be used to control access. (Recall
ls -l.) In our local system, most users most of the time find openness of more
benefit than privacy, but policy may be different on your system, so we'll get
back to this in Chapter 2.

As a final set of experiments with pathnames, try

        $ ls /bin/ /usr/bin

Do some of the names look familiar? When you run a command by typing its name
after the prompt, the system looks for a file of that name. It normally looks
first in your current directory (where is probably doesn't find it), then in
/bin/, and finally in /usr/bin. There is nothing special about commands
