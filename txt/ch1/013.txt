What files are out there?

Let's create two files, junk and temp, so we know what we have:

        $ ed
        a
        To be or not to be
        .
        w junk
        19
        q
        $ ed
        a
        What is a question.
        .
        w temp
        22
        q
        $

The characters counts from ed include the characters at the end of each line,
called newline, which is how the system represents RETURN.

The ls command lists the names (not contents) of files:

        $ ls
        junk
        temp
        $

which are indeed the two files just created. (There might be other as well that
you didn't create yourself.) The names are sorted into alphabetical order
automatically.

ls, like other commands, has options that may be used to alter its default
behavior. Options follow the command name on the command line, and are usually
made up of an initial minus sign '-' and a single letter meant to suggest the
meaning. For example, ls -t causes the files to be listed in "time" order: the
order in which there were last changed, most recent first.

        $ ls -t
        temp
        junk
        $

The -l options gives a "long" listing that provides more information about each
file:

        $ ls -l
        total 2
        -rw-r--r--  1 you            19 Sep 26  16:25 junk
        -rw-r--r--  1 you            22 Sep 26  16:26 temp
        $
