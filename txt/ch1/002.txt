You will need a copy of the UNIX Programmer's Manual, even as you read this
chapter; it's often easier for us to tell you to read about something in the
manual than to repeat its contents here. This book is not supposed to replace
it, but to show you how to make best use of the commands described in
it. Furthermore, there may be differences between what we say here and what is
true on your system. The manual has a permuted index at the beginning that's
indispensable for finding the right programs to apply to a problem; learn to use
it.

Finally, a word of advice: don't be afraid to experiment. If you are a beginner,
there are very few accidental things you can do to hurt yourself or other
users. So learn how things work by trying them. This is a long chapter, and the
best way to read it is a few pages at a time, trying things out as you go.

Some prerequisites about terminals and typing

To avoid explaining everything about using computers, we must assume you have
some familiarity with computer terminals and how to use them. If any of the
following statements are mystifying, you should ask a local expert for help.

The UNIX system is full duplex: the characters you type on the keyboard are sent
to the system, which sends them back to the terminal to be printed on the
screen. Normally, this echo process copies the characters directly to the
screen, so you can see what you are typing, but sometimes, such as when you are
typing a secret password, the echo is turned off so the characters do not appear
on the screen.

Most of the keyboard characters are ordinary printing characters with no special
significance, but a few tell the computer how to interpret your typing. By far
the most important of these is the RETURN key. The RETURN key signifies the end
of a line of input; the system echoes it by moving the terminal's cursor to the
beginning of the next line on the screen. RETURN must be pressed before the
system will interpret the characters you have types.

RETURN is an example of a control character --- an invisible character that
controls some aspect of input and output on the terminal. On any reasonable
terminal, RETURN has a key of its own, but most control characters do not.
Instead, they must be typed by holding down the CONTROL key, sometimes called
CTL or CNTL or CTRL, then pressing another key, usually a letter. For example,
RETURN may be typed by pressing the RETURN key or, equivalently, holding down
the CONTROL key and typing an 'm'. RETURN might therefore be called a control-m,
which we will write as ctl-m. Other control characters include ctl-d, which
tells a program that there is no more input; ctl-g, which rings the bell on the
terminal; ctl-h, often called backspace, which can be used to correct typing
mistakes; and ctl-i, often called tab, which
