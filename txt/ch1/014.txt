"total 2" tells now many blocks of disc space the files occupy; a block is
usually either 512 or 1024 characters. The string -rw-r--r-- tells who has
permission to read and write the file; in this case, the owner (you) can read
and write, but other can only read it. The "1" that follows is the number of
links to the file; ignore it until Chapter 2. "you" is the owner of the file,
that is, the person who created it. 19 and 21 are the number of characters in
the corresponding files, which agree with the numbers you got from ed. The date
and time tell when the file was last changed.

Options can be grouped: ls -lt gives the same data as ls -l, but sorted with
most recent files first. The -u option gives information on when files were
uses: ls -lut gives a long (-l) listing in the order of most recent use. The
option -r reverses the order of the output, so ls -rt lists in order of least
recent use. You can also name the files you're interested in, ls will list the
information about them only:

        $ ls -l junk
        -rw-r--r-- 1 you                19 Sep 26  16:25 junk
        $

The strings that follow the program name on the command line, such as -l and
junk in the example above, are called the program's arguments. Arguments are
usually options or names of files to be used by the command.

Specifying options by a minus sign and a single letter, such as -t or the
combined -lt, is a common convention. In general, if a command accepts such
optional arguments, they precede any filename arguments, but may otherwise
appear in any order. But UNIX programs are capricious in their treatment of
multiple options. For example, standard 7th Edition ls won't accept

$ ls -l -t                              Doesn't work in 7th Edition

as an synonym for ls -lt, while other programs require multiple options to be
separated.

As you learn more, you will find that there is little regularity or system to
optional arguments. Each command has its own idiosyncrasies, and its own choices
of what letter means what (often different from the same function in other
commands). This unpredictable behavior is disconcerting and is often cited as a
major flaw of the system. Although the situation is improving --- new versions
often have more uniformity --- all we can suggest is that you try to do better
when you write your own programs, and in the meantime keep a copy the manual
handy.


Printing files --- cat and pr

Now that you have some files, how do you look at their contents? There are many
programs to do that, probably more than are needed. One possibility is to use
the editor:
