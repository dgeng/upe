        $ ls
        precious
        temp
        $ cat junk
        cat: can't open junk
        $

Beware that if you move a file to another one that already exists, the target
file is replace.

To make a copy of a file (that is, to have two versions of something), use the
cp command:

        $ cp precious precious.save

makes a duplicate copy of precious in precious.save.

Finally, when you get tired of creating and moving files, the rm command removes
all the files you name:

        $ rm temp junk
        rm: junk nonexistent
        $ 

You will get a warning if one of the files to be removed wasn't there, but
otherwise rm, like most UNIX commands, does its work silently. There is no
prompting or chatter, and error messages are curt and sometimes
unhelpful. Brevity can be disconnecting to newcomers, but experienced users find
talkative commands annoying.


What's in a filename?

So far we have used filenames without ever saying what a legal name is, so it's
time for a couple of rules. First, filenames are limited to 14
characters. Second, although you can use almost any character in a filename,
common sense says you should stick to ones that are visible, and that you should
avoid characters that might be used with other meanings. We have already seen,
for example, that in the ls command, ls -t means to list in time order. So if
you had a file whose name was -t, you would have a tough time listing it by
name. (How would you do it?) Besides the minus sign as a first character, there
are other characters with special meaning. To avoid pitfalls, you would do well
to use only letters, numbers, the period and the underscore until you're
familiar with the situation. (The period and the underscore are conventionally
used to divide filenames into chunks, as in precious.save above.) Finally, don't
forget that case distinctions matter --- junk, Junk, and JUNK are three
different names.


A handful of useful commands

Now that you have the rudiments of creating files, listing their names, and
printing their contents, we can look at a half-dozen file-processing commands.
