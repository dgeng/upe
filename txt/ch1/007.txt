depends not only on where they end up but how got there.

Every character you type is immediately echoed to the terminal, unless echoing
is turned off, which is rare. Until you press RETURN, the characters are held
temporarily by the kernel, so typing mistakes can be corrected with the erase
and line kill characters. When an erase or line kill character is preceded by a
backslash, the kernel discards the backslash and holds the following character
without interpretation.

When you press RETURN, the characters being held are sent to the program that is
reading from the terminal. That program may in turn interpret the characters is
special ways; for example, the shell turns off any special interpretation of a
character is it is preceded by a backslash. We'll come back to this in Chapter
3. For now, you should remember that the kernel processes erase and line kill,
and backslash only if it precedes erase or line kill; whatever characters are
left after that may be interpreted by other programs as well.

Exercise 1-1. Explain what happens with

        $ date\@

Exercise 1-2. Most shells (although not the 7th Edition shell) interpret # as
introducing a comment, and ignore all text from the # to the end of the
line. Given this, explain the following transcript, assuming your erase
character is also #

        $ date
        Mon Sep 26 12:39:56 EDT 1983
        $ #date
        Mon Sep 26 12:40:21 EDT 1983
        $ \#date
        $ \\#date
        #date : not found
        $


Type-ahead

The kernel reads what you type as you type it, even if it's busy with something
else, so you can type as fast as you want, whenever you want, even when some
command is printing at you. If you type while the system is printing, your input
characters will appear intermixed with the output characters, but they will be
stored away and interpreted in the correct order. You can type commands one
after another without waiting for them to finish or even to begin.


Stopping a program

You can stop most commands by typing the character DELETE. The BREAK key found
on most terminals may also work, although this is system dependent. In a few
programs, like text editors, DELETE stops whatever the program is doing but
leaves you in that program. Turning off the terminal or
