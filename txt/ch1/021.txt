        $ diff poem new_poem
        2c2
        <   upon their backs to bite 'em,
        ---
        >   upon their backs to bite them,
        4c4
        <   and so ad infinitum.
        ---
        >   and so so ad infinitum.
        $ 

This says that line 2 in the first file (poem) has to be changed into line 2 of
the second file (new_poem), and similarly for line 4.

Generally speaking, cmp is used when you want to be sure that two files really
have the same contents. It's fast and it works on any kind of file, not just
text. diff is used when the files are expected to be somewhat different, and you
want to know exactly which lines differ. diff works only on files of text.


A summary of file system commands

Table 1.1 is a brief summary of the commands we've seen so far that deal with
files.


1.3 More about files: directories

The system distinguishes your file called junk from anyone else's of the same
name. The distinction is made by grouping files into directories, rather in the
way that books are placed on shelves in a library, so files in different
directories can have the same name without any conflict.

Generally each user has a personal or home directory, sometimes called login
directory, that contains only the files that belong to him or her. When you log
in, you are "in" your home directory. You may change the directory you are
working in --- often called your working or current directory --- but your home
directory is always the same. Unless you take special action, when you create a
new file it is made in your current directory. Since this is initially your home
directory, the file is unrelated to a file of the same name that might exist in
someone else's directory.

A directory can contain other directories as well as ordinary files ("Great
directories have lesser directories ..."). The natural way to picture this
organization is as a tree of directories and files. It is possible to move
around within this tree, and to find any file in the system by starting at the
root of the tree and moving along the proper branches. Conversely, you can start
where you are and move toward the root.

Let's try the latter first. Our basic tool is the command pwd ("print working
directory"), which prints the name the directory you are currently in.
