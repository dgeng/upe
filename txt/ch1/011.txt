Thus to read about the who command, type

        $ man who

and, of course

        $ man man

tells about the man command.

Computer-aided instruction

Your system may have a command called learn, which provides computer-aided
instruction on the file system and basic commands, the editor, document
preparation, and even C programming. Try

        $ learn

If learn exists on your system, it will tell you what to do from there. If that
fails, you might also try teach.

Games

It's not always admitted officially, but one of the best ways to get comfortable
with a computer and a terminal is to play games. The UNIX system comes with a
modest supply of games, often supplemented locally. Ask around, or see Section 6
of the manual.


1.2 Day-to-day use: files and common commands

Information in a UNIX system is stored in files, which are much like ordinary
office files. Each file has a name, contents, a place to keep it, and some
administrative information such as who owns it and how big it is. A file might
contain a letter, or a list of names and addresses, or the source statements of
a program, or date to be used by a program, or even programs in their executable
form and other non-textual material.

The UNIX file system is organized so that you can maintain your own personal
files without interfering with files belonging to other people, and keep people
from interfering with you too. There are myriad programs that manipulate files,
but for now, we will look at only the more frequently used ones. Chapter 2
contains a systematic discussion of the file system, and introduces many of the
other file-related commands.


Creating files --- the editor

If you want to type a paper or a letter or a program, how do you get the
information stored in the machine? Most of these tasks are done with a text
editor, which is a program for storing and manipulating information in the
computer. Almost every UNIX system has a screen editor, an editor that takes
advantage of the modern terminals to display the effects of your editing changes
in the context as you make them. Two of the most popular are vi and emacs. We
