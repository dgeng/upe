For practice, send mail to yourself, then type mail to read it. (This isn't as
aberrant as it might sound --- it's a handy reminder mechanism.)

There are other ways to send mail --- you can send a previously prepared letter,
you can mail to a number of people all at once, and you may be able to send mail
to people on other machines. For more details see the description of the mail
command in Section 1 of the UNIX Programmer's Manual. Henceforth we'll use the
notation mail(1) to mean the page describing mail in Section 1 of the
manual. All of the commands discussed in this chapter are found in Section 1.

There may also be a calendar service (see calendar(1)); we'll show you in
Chapter 4 how to set one up if it hasn't been done already.


Writing to other users.

If you UNIX system has multiple users, someday, out of the blue, your terminal
will print something like

        Message from mary tty7...

accompanied by a startling beep. Mary wants to write to you, but unless you take
explicit action you won't be able to write back. To respond, type

        $ write mary

This establishes a two-way communication path. Now the lines that Mary tyeps on
her terminal will appear on yours and vice versa, although the path is slow,
rather like talking to the moon.

If you are in the middle of something, you have to get to a state where you can
type a command. Normally, whatever program you are running has to stop or be
stopped, but some programs, such as the editor and write itself, have a '!'
command to escape temporarily to the shell --- see Table 2 in Appendix 1.

The write command imposes no rules, so a protocol is needed to keep what you
type from getting garbled up with what Mary types. One convention is to take
turns, ending each turn with (o), which stands for "over," and to signal your
intent to quit with (oo), for "over and out."
