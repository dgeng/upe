        $ ls | pr -3 | lpr

creates a 3-column list of filenames on the line printer, and

        $ who | grep mary | wc -l

counts how many times Mary is logged in.

The programs in a pipeline actually run at the same time, not one after
another. This means that the programs in a pipeline can interactive; the kernel
looks after whatever scheduling and synchronization is needed to make it all
work.

As you probably suspect by now, the shell arranges things when you ask for a
pipe; the individual programs are oblivious to the redirection. Of course,
programs have to operate sensibly if you are to be combined this way. most
commands follow a common design, so they will fit properly into pipelines at any
position. normally a command invocation looks like

          command optional-arguments optional-filenames

If no filenames are given, the command reads its standard input, which is by
default the terminal (handy for experimenting) but which can be redirected to
come from a file or a pipe. At the same time, on the output side, most commands
write their output on the standard output, which is by default sent to the
terminal. But it too can be redirected to a file or a pipe.

Error messages from commands have to be handled differently, however, or they
might disappear into a file or down a pipe. So each command has a standard error
output as well, which is normally directed to your terminal. Or, as a picture:


Almost all the commands we have talked about so far fit this model; the only
exceptions are commands like date and who that read no input, and a few like cmp
and diff that have a fixed number of file inputs. (But look at the '-' option on
these.)
