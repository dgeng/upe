the processes in it are all started at once --- the & applies to the whole
pipeline. Only one process-id is printed, however, for the last procedure in the
sequence.

The command

        $ wait

waits until all processes initiated with & have finished. If it doesn't return
immediately, you have commands still running. You can interrupt wait with
DELETE.

you can use the process-id printed by the shell to stop a process initiated with
&:

        $ kill 6944

If you forget the process-id, you can use the command ps to tell you about
everything you have running. If you are desperate, kill 0 will kill all your
processes except your login shell. And if you're curious about what other users
are doing, ps -ag will tell you about all processes that are currently
running. Here is some sample output:

	$ ps -ag
	   PID TTY TIME CMD
	    36 co  6:29	/etc/cron
	  6423 5   0:02 -sh
	  6704 1   0:04 -sh
	  6722 1   0:12 vi paper
	  4430 2   0:03 -sh
	  6612 7   0:03 -sh
	  6628 7   1:13 rogue
	  6843 2   0:02 write dmr
	  6949 4   0:01 login bimmler
	  6952 5   0:08 pr ch1.1 ch1.2 ch1.3 ch1.4
	  6951 5   0:03 lpr
	  6959 5   0:02 ps -ag
	  6844 1   0:02 write rob
	$

PID is the process-id; TTY is the terminal associated with the process (as in
who); TIME is the processor time used in minutes and seconds; and the rest is
the command being run. ps is one of those commands that is different on
different versions of the system, so your output may not be formatted like this.
Even the arguments may be different --- the manual page ps(1).

Processes have the same sort of hierarchical structure that files do: each
process has parent, and may well have children. Your shell was created by a
process associated with whatever terminal line connects you to the system. As
