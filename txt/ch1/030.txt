Given the capability of redirecting output with >, it becomes possible to
combine commands to achieve effects not possible otherwise. For example, to
print an alphabetical list of users,

        $ who >temp
        $ sort <temp

Since who prints one line of output per logged-on user, and wc -l counts lines
(suppressing the word and character counts), you can count users with

        $ who >temp
        $ wc -l <temp

You can count the files in the current directory with

        $ ls >temp
        $ wc -l temp

though this includes the filename temp itself in the count. You can print the
filenames in three columns with

        $ ls >temp
        $ pr -3 <temp

And you can see if a particular user is logged on by combining who and grep:

        $ who >temp
        $ grep mary <temp

In all of these examples, as with filename pattern characters like *, it's
important to remember that the interpretation of > and < is being done by the
shell, not by the individual programs. Centralizing the ability in the shell
means that input and output redirection can be used with any program; the
program itself isn't aware that something unusual has happened.

This brings up an important convention. The command

        $ sort <temp

sorts the contents of the file temp, as does

        $ sort temp

but there is a difference. Because the string <temp is interpreted by the shell,
sort does not see the filename temp as an argument; it instead sorts its
standard input, which the shell has redirected so it comes from the file. The
later example, however, passes the name temp as an argument to sort, which reads
the file and sorts it. sort can be given a list of filenames, as in 

        $ sort temp1 temp2 temp3

but if no filenames are given, it sorts its standard input. This is an essential
property of most commands: if no filenames are specified, the standard input is
processed. This means that you can simply type at commands to see how they
