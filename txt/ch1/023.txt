        $ ls /usr/you

you should get exactly the same list of file names as you get from a plain
ls. When no arguments are provided, ls lists the contents of the current
directory; given the name of the directory, it lists the contents of that
directory.

Next, try

        $ ls /usr

This should print a long series of names, among which is your own login
directory you.

The next step is to try listing the root itself. You should get a response
similar to this:

	$ ls /
	bin
	boot
	dev
	etc
	lib
	tmp
	unix
	usr
	$ 

(Don't be confused by the two meanings of /: it's both the name of the root and
separator in filenames.) Most of these are directories, but unix is actually a
file containing the executable form of the UNIX kernel.More on this in Chapter
2.

Now try

	$ cat /usr/you/junk

(if junk is still in your directory). The name

    	 /usr/you/junk

is called the pathname of the file. "Pathname" has an intuitive meaning: it
represents the full name of the path from the root through the tree of
directories to a particular file. It is a universal rule in the UNIX system that
wherever you can use an ordinary filename, you can use a pathname.

The file system is structured like a genealogical tree; here is a picture that
may make it clearer.
