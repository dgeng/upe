$ ls \?

(Remember that because ? is not the erase or like kill character, this backslash
is interpreted by the shell, not by the kernel.) Quoting is treated at length in
Chapter 3.

Exercise 1-4 What are the differences among these commands?

        $ ls junk                  $ echo junk
        $ ls /                     $ echo /
        $ ls                       $ echo
        $ ls *                     $ echo *
        $ ls '*'                   $ echo '*'



Input-output redirection

Most of the commands we have seen so far produce output on the terminal; some,
like the editor, also take their input from the terminal. It is nearly universal
that terminal can be replaced by a file for either or both of input and
output. As one example,

        $ ls

makes a list of filenames on your terminal. But if you say

        $ ls >filelist

that same list of filenames will be placed in the file filelist instead. The
symbol > means "put the output in the following file, rather than on the
terminal." The file will be created if it doesn't already exist, or the previous
contents overwritten if it does. Nothing is produced on your terminal. As
another example, you can combine several files into one by capturing the output
of cat in a file:

        $ cat f1 f2 f3 >temp

The symbol >> operates much as > does, except that it means "add to the end of."
That is,

        $ cat f1 f2 f3 >>temp

copies the contents of f1 f2 and f3 onto the end of whatever is already in temp,
instead of overwriting the existing contents. As with >, if temp doesn't exist,
it will be created initially empty for you.

In a similar way, the symbol < means to take the input for a program from the
following file, instead of from the terminal. Thus, you can prepare a letter in
file let, then send it to several people with

        $ mail mary joe tom bob <let

In all of these examples, blanks are optional on either side of > or <, but our
formatting is traditional.
