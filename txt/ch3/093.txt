        $ cp junk ch3.1
        $ time wc ch3.1 >wc.out

        real        2.0
        user        0.4
        sys         0.3
        $ time wc ch3.1 >wc.out 2>time.out
        $ cat time.out

        real        1.0
        user        0.4
        sys         0.3
        $

The construction 2>filename (no spaces are allowed between the 2 and the >)
directs the standard error output into the file; it's syntactically graceless
but it does the job. (The times produced by time are not very accurate for such
a short test as this one, but for a sequence of longer testes the numbers are
useful and reasonably trustworthy, and you might well want to save them for
further analysis; see, for example, Table 8.1)

It is also possible to merge the two output streams:

        $ time wc ch3.1 >wc.out 2>&1
        $ cat wc.out
            931   4288   22691 ch3.1

        real        1.0
        user        0.4
        sys         0.3
        $

The notation 2>&1 tells the shell to put the standard error on the same stream
as the standard output. There is not much mnemonic value to the ampersand; it's
simply an idiom to be learned. You can also use 1>&2 to add the standard output
to the standard error:

        echo ... 1>&2

prints on the standard error. In shell files, it prevents the messages from
vanishing accidentally down a pipe or into a file.

The shell provides a mechanism so you can put the standard input for a command
along with the command, rather than in a separate file, so the shell file can be
completely self-contained. Our directory information program 411 could be
written
