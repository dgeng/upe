        # lc: count number of lines in files
        wc -l $*                                Looks good

        $ bundle `pick *` | mail somewhere!bob     Send the files

There's a problem if one of the files you're sending happens to contain a line
of the form

        End of filename

but it's a low-probability event. To make bundle utterly safe, we need a thing
or two from later chapters, but it's eminently usable and convenient as it
stands.

bundle illustrates much of the flexibility of the UNIX environment: it uses
shell loops, I/O redirection, here document and shell files, it interfaces
directly to mail, and, perhaps most interesting, it is a program that creates a
program. It's one of the prettiest shell programs we know --- a few lines of
code that do something simply, useful and elegant.

Exercise 3-17. How would you use bundle to send all the files in a directory and
its subdirectories? Hint: shell files can be recursive.

Exercise 3-18. Modify bundle so it includes with each file the information
garnered from ls -l, particularly permissions and date of last change. Contrast
the facilities of bundle with the archive program ar(1).


3-10 Why a programmable shell?

The UNIX shell isn't typical of command interpreters: although it lets you run
commands in the usual way, because it is a programming language it can
accomplish much more. It's worth a brief look at what we've seen, in part
because there's a lot of material in this chapter but more because we promised
to talk about "commonly used features" and then wrote about 30 pages of shell
programming examples. But when using the shell you write little one-line
programs all the time: a pipeline is a program, as is our"Tea is ready"
example. The shell works like that: you program it constantly, but it's so easy
and natural (once you're familiar with it) that you don't think of it as
programming.

The shell does some things, like looping, I/O redirection with < and >, and
filename expansion with *, so that no program need worry about them, and more
importantly, so that the application of these facilities is uniform across all
programs. Other features, such as shell files and pipes, are really provided by
the kernel, but the shell gives a natural syntax for creating them. They go
