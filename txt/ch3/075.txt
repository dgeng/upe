dot, to avoid problems with the names '.' and '..' that are in every
directory. The rule is: the filename-matching characters only match filenames
beginning with a period if the period is explicitly supplied in the pattern. As
usual, a judicious echo or two will clarify what happens:

	$ ls
	.profile
	junk
	temp
	$ echo *
	junk temp
	$ echo .*
	. .. .profile
	$

Characters like * that have special properties are known as
metacharacters. There are a lot of them: Table 3.1 in the complete list,
although a few of them won't be discussed until Chapter 5.

Given the number of shell metacharacters, there has to be some way to say to the
shell, "Leave it along." The easiest and best way to protect special characters
from being interpreted is to enclose them in single quote characters:

        $ echo '***'
	***
        $

It's also possible to use the double quotes "...", but the shell actually peeks
inside these quotes to look for $, `...`, and \, so don't use "..." unless you
intend some processing of the quoted string.

A third possibility is to put a backslash \ in front of each character that you
want to protect from the shell, as in

        $ echo \*\*\*

Although \*\*\* isn't much like English, the shell terminology for it is still a
word, which is any single string the shell accepts as a unit, including blanks
if they are quoted.

Quotes of one kind protect quotes of the other kind:

        $ echo "Don't do that!"
	Don't do that!
        $

and they don't have to surround the whole argument:

        $ echo x'*'y
	x*y
	$ echo '*'A'?'
	*A?
	$
