is named as an argument; you could have written

        $ sh nu

for the same result. But it's a nuisance to have to type "sh" in either case:
it's longer, and it creates a distinction between program written in, say, C and
ones written by connecting programs with the shell.+ Therefore, if a file is
executable and if it contains text, then the shell assumes it to be a file or
shell commands. Such a file is called a shell file. All you have to do is to
make nu executable, once:

        $ chmod +x nu

and thereafter you can invoke it with

        $ nu

From now on, users from nu cannot tell, just by running it, that you implemented
it in this easy way.

The way the shell actually runs nu is to create a new shell process exactly as
if you had typed

        $ sh nu

This child shell is called a sub-shell --- a shell process invoked by your
current shell. sh nu is not the same as sh <nu, because its standard input still
connected to the terminal.

As it stands, nu works only if it's in your current directory (provided, of
course, that the current directory is in your PATH, which we will assume from
now on). To make nu part of your repertoire regardless of what directory you're
in, move it to your private bin directory, and add /usr/you/bin to your search
path:

        $ pwd
        /usr/you
        $ mkdir bin                     Make a bin if you haven't already
        $ echo $PATH                    Check PATH for sure
        :/usr/you/bin:/bin:/usr/bin     Should look like this
        $ mv nu bin                     Install nu
        $ ls nu
        nu not found                    It's really gone from current directory
        $ nu
              4                         But it's found by the shell
              
        $

of course, your PATH should be set properly by your .profile, so you don't have
to reset it every time you log in.

There are other simple commands that you might create this way to tailor

+ Nonetheless, it is a distinction made on most other operating systems.
