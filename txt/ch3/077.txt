$ echo x*y

echoes all the filenames beginning x and ending with y. As always, echo knows
nothing about files or shell metacharacters; the interpretation of *, if any, is
supplied by the shell.

What happens if no files match the pattern? The shell, rather than complaining
(as it did in early versions), passes the string on as though it had been
quoted. It's usually a bad idea to depend on this behavior, but it can be
exploited to learn of the existence of files matching a pattern:

        $ ls x*y                        Message from ls: no such files exist
        x*y not found                   Create xyzzy
        $ >xyzzy
        $ ls x*y                        File xyzzy matches x*y
        xyzzy
        $ ls 'x*y'
        x*y not found                   ls doesn't interpret the *
        $

A backslash at the end of a line causes the line to be continued; this is the
way to present a very long line to the shell.

        $ echo abc\
        > def\
        > ghi
        abcdefghi
        $

Notice that the newline is discarded when preceded b backslash, but is retained
when it appears in quotes.

The metacharacter # is almost universally used for shell commands; if a shell
word begins with #, the rest of the lines is ignored:

        $ echo hello # there
        hello
        $ echo hello#there
        hello#there
        $

The # was not part of the original 7th Edition, but it has been adopted very
widely, and we will use it in the rest of the book.


Exercise 3-2. Explain the output produced by

        $ ls .*


A digression on echo

Even though it isn't explicitly asked for, a final newline is provided by
echo. A sensible and perhaps cleaner design for echo would be to print only
