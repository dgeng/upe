        :/usr/you/bin:/bin:/usr/bin              PATH unchanged
        $ cat /usr/you/bin/games
        PATH=$PATH:/usr/games                    games command still there
        $ . games
        $ fortune

        $

It's possible to exploit both these mechanism in a single shell file. A slightly
different games command can be used to run a single game without changing PATH,
or can set PATH permanently to include /usr/games:

        $ cat /usr/you/bin/games
        PATH=$PATH:/usr/games $*                    Note the $*
        $ cx /usr/you/bin/games
        $ echo $PATH
        :/usr/you/bin:/bin:/usr/bin                 Doesn't have /usr/games
        $ games fortune
        I'd give my right arm to be ambidextrous.
        $ echo $PATH
        :/usr/you/bin:/bin:/usr/bin                 Still doesn't
        $ . games
        $ echo $PATH
        :/usr/you/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/games      Now it does
        $ fortune

The first call to games ran the shell file in a sub-shell, where PATH was
temporarily modified to include /usr/games. The second example instead
interpreted the file in the current shell, with $* the empty string, so there
was no command on the line, and PATH was modified. Using games in these two ways
is tricky, but results in a facility that is convenient and natural to use.

When you want to make the value a variable accessible in sub-shell, the shell''s
export command should be used. (You might think about why there is no way to
export the value of variable from a sub-shell to its parent.) Here is one of our
earlier examples, this time with the variable exported:

        $ x=Hello
        $ export x
        $ sh                              New shell
        $ echo $x
        Hello                             x known in sub-shell
