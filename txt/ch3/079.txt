There dwelt in the land of New Jersey the UNIX, a fair maid who savants traveled
far to admire. Dazzled by her purity, all sought to espouse her, one for her
virginal grace, another for her polished civility, yet another for her agility
in performing exacting tasks seldom accomplished even much richer land. So large
of heart and accommodating of nature was she that the UNIX adopted all but the
most insufficiently rich of her suitors. Soon many offspring grew and prospered
and spread to the ends of the earth.

Nature herself smiled and answered to the UNIX more eagerly than to other mortal
beings. Humbler folk, who knew little of more courtly manners, delighted in her
echo, so precise and crystal clear they scarce believed she could be answered by
the same rocks and woods that so garbled their own shouts into the
wilderness. And the compliant UNIX obliged with perfect echoes of whatever she
was asked.

When one impatient swain asked the UNIX, 'Echo nothing,' the UNIX obligingly
opened her mouth, echoed nothing, and closed it again.

'Whatever do you mean,' The youth demanded, 'opening your mouth like that?
Henceforth never open your mouth when you are supposed to echo nothing!' And the
UNIX obliged.

'But I want a perfect performance, even when you echo nothing,' pleaded a
sensitive youth, 'and no perfect echoes can come from a closed mouth.' not
wishing to offend either one, the UNIX agreed to say different nothings for the
impatient youth and the sensitive youth. She called the sensitive nothing '\n.'

Yet now when she said '\n,' she was really not saying nothing so she had to open
her mouth twice, once to say '\n,' and once to say nothing, and so she did not
please the sensitive youth, who said forthwith, "The \n sounds like a perfect
nothing to me, but the second one ruins it. I want you to take back one of
them.' So the UNIX, who could not abide offending, agreed to undo some echoes,
and called that '\c.' Now the sensitive youth could hear a perfect echo of
nothing by asking for '\n' and '\c' together. But they say that he died of a
surfeit of notation before he ever heard one.


Exercise 3-3. Predict what each of the following grep commands will do, then
verify your understanding.

        grep \$                 grep \\
        grep \\$                grep \\\\
        grep \\\$               grep "\$"
        grep '\$'               grep '"$'
        grep '\'$'              grep "$"

A file containing these commands themselves makes a good test case if you want
to experiment.

Exercise 3-4. How do you tell grep to search for a pattern beginning with a '-'?
Why doesn't quoting the argument help? Hint: investigate the -e option.

Exercise 3-5. Consider

        $ echo */*

Does this produce all names in all directories? In what order do the names
appear?

Exercise 3-6. (Trick question) How do you get a / into a filename (i.e., a /
that doesn't separate components of the path)?

Exercise 3-7. What happens with
