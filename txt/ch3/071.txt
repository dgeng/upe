The shell --- the program that interprets your requests to run programs --- is
the most important program for most UNIX users; with the possible exception of
your favorite text editor, you will spend more time working with the shell than
any other program. In this chapter and in Chapter 5, we will spend a fair amount
of time on the shell's capabilities. The main point we want to make is that you
can accomplish a lot without much hard work, and certainly without resorting to
programming in a conventional language like C, if you know how to use the shell.

We have divided our coverage of the shell into two chapters. This chapter goes
one step beyond the necessities covered in Chapter 1 to some fancier but
commonly used shell features, such as metacharacters, quoting, creating new
commands, passing arguments to them, the use of shell variables, and some
elementary control flow. These are topics you should know for your own use of
the shell. The material in Chapter 5 is heavier going --- it is intended for
writing serious shell programs, ones that are bullet-proofed for use by
others. The division between the two chapters is somewhat arbitrary, of course,
so both should be read eventually.


3.1 Command line structure 

To proceed, we need a slightly better understanding of just what a command is,
and how it is interpreted by the shell. This section is more formal coverage,
with new information, of the shell basics introduced in the frst chapter.

The simplest command is a single work, usually naming a file for execution
(later we will see some other types of commands):

	$ who  	   	      	       Execute the file /bin/who 
	you      tty2    Sep 28 07:51 
	jpl      tty4    Sep 28 08:32 
	$ 

A command usually ends with a new line, but semicolon; is also a command
terminator:
