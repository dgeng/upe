        $ date; who
        Wed Sep 28 09:07:23 EDT 1983
        you      tty2    Sep 28 07:51

        $ 

Although semicolons can be used to terminate commands, as usual nothing happens
until you type RETURN. Notice that the shell only prints one prompt after
multiple commands, but except for the prompt,

        $ date; who

is identical to typing the two commands on different lines. In particular, who
doesn't run until date has finished.

Try sending the output of "date; who" through a pipe:

        $ date; who | wc
        Wed Sep 28 09:08:48 EDT 1983
              2     10     60
        $ 

This might not be what you expected, because only the output of who goes to
wc. Connecting who and wc with a pipe forms a single command, called a pipeline,
that runs after date. The precedence of | is higher than that of ';' as the
shell parses the command line.

Parentheses can be used to group commands:

        $ (date; who)
        Wed Sep 28 09:11:09 EDT 1983
        you      console Jan  1 23:27
        you      tty2    Sep 28 07:51
        jpl      tty4    Sep 28 08:32
        $ (date; who) | wc
              3     16      89
        $ 

The output of date and who are concatenated into a single stream that can be
sent down a pipe.

Data flowing through a pipe can be tapped and placed in a file (but not another
pipe) with the tee command, which is not part of the shell, but is nonetheless
handy for manipulating pipes. One use is to save intermediate output int a file:
