your environment to your own taste. Some that we have found convenient include

* cs, which echoes the proper sequence of mysterious characters to clear the
  screen on your terminal (24 newlines is a fairly general implementation);

* what, which runs who and ps -a to tell who's logged on and what they are
  doing;

* where, which prints the identifying name of the UNIX system you're using ---
  it's handy if you use several regularly. (Setting PS1 serves a similar
  purpose.)

Exercise 3-9. Look in /bin and /usr/bin to see how many commands are actually
shell files. Can you do it with one command? Hint: file(1). How accurate are
guesses based on file length?


3.4 Command arguments and parameters

Although nu is adequate as it stands, most shell programs interpret arguments,
so that, for example, filenames ad options can be specified when the program is
run.

Suppose we want to make a program called cx to change the mode of a file to
executable, so

        $ cx nu

is a shorthand for

        $ chmod +x nu

We already know almost enough to do this. We need a file called cx whose
contents are

        chmod +x filename

The only new thing we need to know is how to tell cx what the name of the file
is, since it will be different each time cx is run.

When the shell executes a file of commands, each occurrence of $1 is replaced by
the first argument, each $2 is replaced by the second argument, and so on
through $9. So if the file cx contains

        chmod +x $1

when the command

        $ cx nu

is run, the sub-shell replaces "$1" by its first argument, "nu."

Let's look at the whole sequence of operations:
