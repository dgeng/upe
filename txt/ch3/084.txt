will be null, and no arguments at all will be passed to wc or mail. With or
without arguments, the command is invoked properly:

        $ cl /usr/you/bin/*
              1 /usr/you/bin/cx
              2 /usr/you/bin/lc
              2 /usr/you/bin/m
              1 /usr/you/bin/nu
              2 /usr/you/bin/what
              1 /usr/you/bin/where
              9 total
        $ ls /usr/you/bin | lc
              6
        $

These commands and the others in this chapter are examples of personal programs,
the sort of things you write for yourself and put in your bin, but are unlikely
to make publicly available because they are too dependent on personal taste. In
Chapter 5 we will address the issues of writing shell programs suitable for
public use.

The arguments to a shell file need not be filenames. For example, consider
searching a personal telephone directory. If you have a file named
/usr/you/lib/phone-book that contains lines like

        dial-a-joke  212-976-3838
        dial-a-prayer  212-246-4200
        dial santa  212-976-3636
        dow jones report  212-976-4141

then the grep command can be used to search it. (your own lib directory is a
good place to store such personal data bases.) Since grep doesn't care about the
format of information, you can search for names, addresses, zip codes or
anything else that you like. Let's make a directory assistance program, which
we'll call 411 in honor of the telephone directory assistance number where we
live:

        $ echo 'grep $* /usr/you/lib/phone-book' >411
        $ cx 411
        $ 4111 joke
        dial-a-joke  212-976-3838
        $ 411 dial
        dial-a-joke  212-976-3838
        dial-a-prayer  212-246-4200
        dial santa  212-976-3636
        $ 411 'dow jones'
        grep: can't open jones                  Something is wrong
        $

The final example is included to show a potential problem: even though dow jones
is presented to 411 as a single argument, it contains a space and is no
