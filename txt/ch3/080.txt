        $ cat x y >y

and with

        $ cat x >>x

Think before rushing off to try them.

Exercise 3-8. If you type

        $ rm *

why can't rm warn you that you're about to delete all your files?


3.3 Creating new commands

It's now time to move on to something that we promised in Chapter 1 --- how to
create new commands out of old ones.

Given a sequence of commands that is to be repeated more than a few times, it
would be convenient to make it into a "new" command with its own name, so you
can use it like a regular command. To be specific, suppose you intend to count
users frequently with the pipeline

        $ who | wc -l

that was mentioned in Chapter 1, and you want to make a few program nu to do
that

The first step is to create an ordinary file that contains 'who | wc -l'. You
can use a favorite editor, of you can get creative:

        $ echo 'who | wc -l' >nu

(Without the quotes, what would appear in nu?)

As we said in Chapter 1, the shell is a program just like an editor or who or
wc; its name is sh. And since it's a program, you can run it and redirect its
input. So run the shell with its input coming from the file nu instead of the
terminal:

        $ who
        you      tty2    Sep 28 07:51
        rhh      tty4    Sep 28 10:02
        moh      tty5    Sep 28 09:38
        ava      tty6    Sep 28 10:17
        $ cat nu
        who | wc -l
        $ sh <nu
              4
        $

The output is the same as it would have been if you had typed who | wc -l at the
terminal.

Again like most other programs, the shell takes its input from a file if one
