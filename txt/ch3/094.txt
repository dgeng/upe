The shell jargon for this construction is a here document; it means that the
input is right here instead of in a file somewhere. The << signals the
construction; the word that follows (End in our example) is used to delimit the
input, which is taken to be everything up to an occurrence of that word on line
by itself. The shell substitutes for $, `...`, and \ in a here document, unless
some part of the word is quoted with quotes or a backslash; in that case, the
whole document is taken literally.

We'll return to here documents are the end the chapter, with a much more
interesting example.

Table 3.2 lists the various input-output redirections that the shell
understands.

Exercise 3-14. Compare the here-document version of 411 with the original. Which
is easier to maintain? Which is a better basis for a general service?

3.8 Looping in shell programs

The shell is actually a programming language: it has variables, loops,
decision-making, and so on. We will discuss basic looping here, and talk more
about control flow in Chapter 5.
