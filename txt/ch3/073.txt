tee copies its input to the named file or files, as well as to its output, so wc
receives the same date as if tee weren't in the pipeline.

Another command terminator is the ampersand &. It's exactly like the semicolon
or newline, except that it tells the shell not to wait for the command to
complete. Typically, & is used to run a long-running command "in the background"
while you continue to type interactive commands:

        $ long-running-command &
        5273                            Process-id of long-running-command
        $                               Prompt appears immediately

Given the ability to group commands, there are some more interesting uses of
background processes. The command sleep waits the specified number of seconds
before exiting.

        $ sleep 5
        $                               Five seconds pass before prompt
        $ (sleep 5; date) & date
        5278
        Wed Sep 28 09:18:20 EDT 1983    Ouput from second date
        $ Wed Sep 28 09:18:25 EDT 1983  Prompt appears, then date 5 etc. later

The background process starts but immediately sleeps; meanwhile, the second date
command prints the current time and the shell prompts for a new command. Five
seconds later, the sleep exits and the first date prints the new time. It's hard
to represent the passage of time on paper, so you should try this
example. (Depending on how busy your machine is and other such details, the
difference between the two times might not be exactly five seconds.) This is any
easy way to run a command in the future; consider

        $ (sleep 300; echo Tea is ready) &     Tea will be ready in 5 minutes
        5291
        $

as a handy reminder mechanism. (A ctl-g in the string to be echoed will ring the
terminal's bell when it's printed.) The parentheses are needed in these
examples, since the precedence of & is higher than that of ';'.

The & terminator applies to the commands, and since pipelines are commands you
don't need parentheses to run pipelines in the background:
