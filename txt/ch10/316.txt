algorithm in diff. Binding it all together was a kernel with "features seldom
found even in larger operating systems." As an example, consider the I/O
structure: a hierarchical file system, rare at the time; devices installed as
names in the file system, so they require no special utilities; and perhaps a
dozen critical system calls, such as an open primitive with exactly two
arguments. The software was all written in a high-level language and distributed
with the system so it could be studied and modified.

The UNIX system has since become one of the computer market's standard operating
system, and with market dominance has come responsibility and the need for
"features" provided by the operating system. As a result, the kernel has grown
in size by a factor of 10 in the past decade, although it has certainly not
improved by the same amount. This growth has been accompanied by a surfeit of
ill-conceived programs that don't build on the existing environment. Creeping
featurism encrusts commands with options that obscure the original intention of
the programs. Because source code is often not distributed with the system,
models of good style are harder come by.

Fortunately, however, even the large versions are still suffused with the ideas
that made the early versions so popular. The principles on which UNIX is based
--- simplicity of structure, the lack of disproportionate means, building on
existing programs rather than recreating, programmability of the command
interpreter, a tree-structured file system, and so on --- are therefore
spreading and displacing the ideas in the monolithic systems that preceded
it. The UNIX system can't last forever, but systems that hope to supersede it
will have to incorporate many of its fundamental ideas.

We said in the preface that there is a UNIX approach or philosophy, a style of
how to approach a programming task. Looking back over the book, you should be
able to see the elements of that style illustrated in our examples.

First, let the machine do the work. Use programs like grep and wc and awk to
mechanize tasks that you might do by hand on other systems.

Second, let other people do the work. Use programs that already exist as
building blocks in your programs, with the shell and the programmable filters to
glue them together. Write a small program to interface to an existing on that
does the real work, as we did with idiff. The UNIX environment is rich in tools
that can be combined in myriad ways; your job is often just to think of the
right combination.

Third, do the job in stages. Build the simplest thing that will be useful, and
let your experience with that determine what (if anything) is worth doing
next. Don't add features and options until usage patterns tell you which ones
are needed.

Forth, build tools. Write programs that mesh with the existing environment,
enhancing it rather than merely adding to it. Built well, such programs
themselves become a part of everyone's toolkit.

We also said in the preface that the system was not perfect. After nine chapters
describing programs that strange conventions, pointless differences,
